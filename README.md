# RedBlackTreeVisualizerCPP
Red Black Tree in C++ with a visualizer in console.

## How To Use

When the program is run, the user has the option to add,
remove, or exit.  Adding to and removing from the tree 
updates the tree and displays what the tree will end up 
looking like.

### How To Run
Either clone the repository and run the program, or [click here](https://github.com/ChrisMansourian/RedBlackTreeVisualizerCPP/blob/main/RedBlackTree.exe) to download the exe.  If downloaded, windows security may prevent you from running the program.  If this occurs, click more info and then run anyways.
